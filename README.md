# RioBermejoPOC
This repository contains R scripts and field data used to model fluvial POC transit and turnover for the Rio Bermejo, Argentina.
This project implements SoilR to model the transfer of particulate organic carbon (POC) from upstream to downstream through a large alluvial river system.
We model the river POC flux and fit the model output delta14C and OC load to field measurements of these values.
